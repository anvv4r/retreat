        <p>
          We organise a retreat camp in the forests of The Castle-Crowsnest
          Watershed Natural Area (CCWNA) in southwest Alberta, Canada. The camp
          allows you to withdraw for two weeks from all the stresses of life in
          the city and enjoy an intimate connection with nature, meet new people
          and heal your inner self.
